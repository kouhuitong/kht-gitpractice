- Contact this student to ask for their GitHub handle (or GitHub "name")
- Give "collaborator" access to this person (go to Settings then Manage access, then invite them using their GitHub name).
- After this person accepts your invitation and clone your repository, find a time to meet via BBCU (you may use the main course room) or zoom or some other platform of your choice.
- Exchange ideas about what to add to your repository.
- Based on these ideas, both of you should edit the same file around the same place, separately, make a commit and push your commits to GitHub to create a conflict. Let the other person push their commit first, so you push second and you resolve the conflict. Actually: you will need to pull the other person's commit that conflicts with your own, resolve the conflict locally, then push the merged commit.
- Repeat the same process, but on the other student's repository. This time, you should push your commit first, and the other student should resolve the conflict for the repository that they own.
